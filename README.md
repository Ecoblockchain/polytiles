# polytiles.py

A script to get tiles from mapnik. Area can be defined by bbox, polygon or an OSM polygon; tiles can be served in image files or mbtiles. Run the script without parameters to see command line help.

## Requirements

Packages `python-shapely`, `python-psycopg2` and `gdal-python`. And mapnik, of course.
